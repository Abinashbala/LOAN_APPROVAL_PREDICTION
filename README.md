**Project Title: Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning** 

Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict loan default probabilities, helping financial institutions minimize risk and improve decision-making.

Approach:

Conducted EDA to identify patterns in borrower behavior and key factors affecting loan default.
Performed data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers) and feature engineering (encoding categorical features, creating credit score-based variables).
Implemented classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict loan defaults.
Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning using RandomsearchCv and validated results with cross-validation.
Evaluated models using metrics such as Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Results: Achieved 95.3% Accuracy and a Weighted F1-Score of 95.08 using the Tuned XGBoost Classifier, outperforming baseline models.
